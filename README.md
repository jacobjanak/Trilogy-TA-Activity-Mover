# Instructions
1. First, customize this line in `mover.py`:

`instructorRepoPath = '/Users/jacobjanak/documents/code/trilogy/FullStack-Lesson-Plans'`

You should replace that string with your own path to the FullStack-Lesson-Plans repository.

2. Open the command line and `cd` to the activity folder within the current week of your class repo. Basically, you should be inside an `01-Activities` folder. It is important that you are in the correct directory as this files behavior depends entirely on that! Then, run this command:

`python <path-to-mover.py> <week-number> <activity-number>`

3. A `Solved` folder should now appear inside the activity you specified!
